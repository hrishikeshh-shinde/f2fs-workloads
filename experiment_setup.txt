Setup:

-> FEMU emulator with 16GB SSD
-> F2FS filesystem (formatted fresh for each test)

Identical workload for all engines:

-> Phase 1: Insert 10 million 1KB records (10GB cold data)
-> Phase 2: Update 1 million records 3 times (3GB hot updates)
-> Phase 3: Delete 2 million records (creates fragmentation)
-> Total: 13GB logical writes per engine

Metrics collected:

-> Zombie blocks (% with 30-70% invalid pages) - from FEMU block stats
-> Write Amplification (WAF) - physical writes / logical writes
-> GC time - from F2FS kernel tracepoints
