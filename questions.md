1. can we get better zombie blocks using the csv file? current results.txt has data at end state which isnt that relevant since that is after gc
2. how can we use the results to prove the problem exists?
3. hypothesis? waf caused by the db or gc how can we separate them?
4. verify results
5. do we need to use any other fs to show it does bad with f2fs?
6. there is no definite way to prove that our thing works without fdp, how to go about that?
7. if we get lucky with fdp we can again perform with and without our code for better results
